                    WINTER NIGHT

               And far and near the blizzard raced,
               Through every endland.
               A burning candle lit the place,
               A burning candle.

               As to a swarm of summer moths
               Are flame and glow,
               The window frame attractive was
               To flakes of snow.

               There on the pane a frosted fresque
               Grew: circles, angles.
               A burning candle lit the desk,
               A burning candle.

               On the enlightened ceiling easel
               Fell shapes retracing
               Entangled arms, entangled knees,
               Fates interlacing.

               And thuddingly two little shoes
               Were dropping down,
               And wax in tears, heat-melted loose,
               Dripped on the gown.

               And melted all in silver gloom,
               Obscure and swirling.
               A burning candle lit the room,
               A candle burning.

               Caught in a draft, the flame would swing,
               And stormy passions
               Spread wings, like tempted angels, in
               Cruciform fashion.

               That winter, blizzards held the pace;
               Their calls returning,
               A burning candle lit the place,
               A candle burning.
